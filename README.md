# Kenzie Hub


This is a project called Kenzie Hub, developed in React and deployed on Vercel. Kenzie Hub is a web application that allows user registration and login, as well as access to a dashboard after logging in.

## About the Project

Kenzie Hub uses the Kenzie Hub API to manage user registration and login. The API documentation can be found at [link_to_api_documentation](https://github.com/Kenzie-Academy-Brasil-Developers/kenziehub-api#-cria%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-usu%C3%A1rio-).

To get started with Kenzie Hub, you can clone this repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/kenzie-hub.git

Pages and Components
The project is divided into several pages and components. Initially, you can create the basic structure of components, including the Login, Registration, and Dashboard pages. In addition to page division, componentizing forms and other structures is an excellent architectural practice for the project.

Application Routes
With the components created, it's time to implement the application routes using React Router Dom. Here are some route suggestions:

/ for the Login page (LoginPage)
/register for the Registration page (RegisterPage)
/dashboard for the Dashboard page (DashboardPage) state, remove the token from localStorage, and redirect the user to the home page.
